When the decision has been taken to deprecate an API:

* For beta products the deprecation period must be at least 30 days (60 days recommended)
* For GA products the deprecation period must be at least 1 year
* Warning emails will be sent to the API at regular intervals before the deprecation time
* A guide will be supplied to customers explaining how to migrate to the replacement API with the initial deprecation notice.


### Why did we choose this?

#### Beta:

Discussed in #api-standards due to the messaging/workflows release.

Participants:

* Aristoula Goulia
* Hugh Hopkins
* Michael Heap
